I have never attempted to use any Office365 or SharePoint APIs in my career to this point. The difficulty involved in figuring out exactly what I needed to do to retrieve and post some data to Office365 was much higher than I anticipated. This was because almost every tutorial I encountered, or quick start option within Office365 was aimed at user centric applications. My application did not have user input, it was an automated task.

The struggle to figure out how it all fits together is what inspired this post, so I can use this for future reference if I need to complete a task like this again.
