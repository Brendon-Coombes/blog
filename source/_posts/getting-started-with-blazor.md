I have been hearing lots of positive things about Blazor around the office, on podcasts, and on Twitter recently. So I have finally decided to dig into it and see what it is all about.

In this post I get started with Blazor and take you through the steps I took to get a finished application.

## What is Blazor

Blazor is .NET code run on the client side. It does this using the WebAssembly standard. At the time of writing this post; it is still an experimental project and has not been given any indication of commitment from Microsoft in terms of being a long term supported product.

`TODO: More info on BLAZOR / WebAssembly and how it works and what it means for the future.

Because it is so rapidly developed, it is likely that by the time you have read this post, some of what I have written will be out of date. I know that makes this post less than ideal for getting a gauge of how to use it, but I really wanted to share my experience on using Blazor for the first time.
