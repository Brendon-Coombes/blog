Recently I found myself needing to use an excel file as a source of data for a website, and wanted to try out using Microsoft Flow to get my data rather than manually checking the file for changes and pulling the data myself.

## Backstory

In the office, a few of us have all picked up the Crash Bandicoot N' Sane Trilogy. We all think we are the best at the game and have become quite competitive over the relic times on the levels.

We were attempting to use the leader boards on the [Crash Bandicoot website](https://crashbandicoot.com/leaderboards) but we ran into quite a few problems with this. The first problem was that we can not search by player name on the leaderboard, we would manually have to click through each page of 20 times looking for our time on each level.

The second problem was that the leaderboards seem to be wildly unstable, a lot of the time just attempting to use the web site to browse a page or two deep would cause them to crash [no pun intended].
