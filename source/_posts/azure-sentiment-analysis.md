Recently I was given the feedback that I am quite negative in the office. I was not surprised by this feedback as I have noticed it in myself too, and I want to do something about it.

I have a goal to be more positive in 12 months time, but the problem with that goal is that it is pretty hard to measure, it will just be about perspective of others around me without any "concrete" proof.

In order to have some fact behind whether or not I achieve my goal, I going to attempt to use Azure Sentiment Analysis on my social media and emails for the next 12 months.

In this post, I discuss what I am intending to measure and what I have set up with Azure to help me measure it.

## What is Azure Cognitive


Enter - Azure Cognitive Services - Text Analysis
Text analysis free does 5000 per month
Social Media, I am not very vocal on social media - so will make an effort to post more in general especially about how I am feeling about issues
Emails - talk about 5000 character limit - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview#supported-languages
Manual task at this point, will look into automating it on send on emails

Things I could have also looked at:
- Speech to text - 5 hours free per month.
