title: About
---

I am a Software Developer working for an IT Services firm in Dunedin, New Zealand.
I have worked here since 2013 developing a range of different solutions for all sorts of businesses in New Zealand, Australia, and the USA.

I am mainly interested in working on .NET applications, but am slowly branching out to try other things. The content you will find on this blog will mainly be about .NET and Microsoft based products.

None of the content on this blog is sponsored, and is solely my opinion of that product/technology/methodolgy, no one is paying me to say anything.
